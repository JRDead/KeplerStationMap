# KeplerStationMap

This is the repo for KeplerStation, a map that has been under development since September, 2024.
The map has been designed using Fulpstation's codebase. I intend to, at some point, ask for the map to be tested there, but I'm not sure if that will happen so, until then, this is a pet project.
If you wish to collaborate feel free to ask me via Discord: fluctlightt.

Thank you for reading!

## Files and Folders to modify when testing

### _maps

Place KeplerStation.dmm here.

### _maps\shuttles

Place arrival_kepler.dmm, cargo_kepler; and emergency_kepler here.

### config\maps.txt

Copy and paste or replace the content of the file using those in the "Files to modify" folder.

### fulp_modules\mapping\shuttles\map_templates.dm

Copy and paste or replace the content of the file using those in the "Files to modify" folder.

## When testing

Once you have the repo and start the game, go to change map and pick KeplerStation. It should show up if you did the previous step.
